/// The SSL mode dropdown used to branch on `driver === "postgres"` literally
/// (issue #614), so a postgres-dialect driver with a different id (e.g. the
/// standalone PostgreSQL plugin, id `"postgresql"`) offered MySQL-style
/// underscored `ssl_mode` values instead of Postgres-style hyphenated ones.
/// The plugin's own TLS check only recognizes the hyphenated spelling, so a
/// connection saved with the wrong-family value connects in cleartext with no
/// error. Fixing the dropdown only stops *new* saves from getting the wrong
/// value — this rewrites values already persisted before the fix shipped.
///
/// Maps a stale MySQL-style `ssl_mode` value to its Postgres-style
/// equivalent. Returns `None` for a value that isn't one of the stale
/// MySQL-style spellings (including values already correct, or driver-
/// specific values like ClickHouse's `"disable"`/`"require"`, which happen to
/// already be spelled correctly in both families and need no rewrite).
